How to derive the robot model from urdf.xacro files.

Xacro is used to evaluate and apply macros to urdf files. All the needed information is within the urdf files, hence, no
additional files are required in order to generate the standard urdf file.

Xacro is distributed with ros, see ros website for further information.

Instruction to run xacro on urdf.xacro files:

1- cd to the folder where the main urdf.xacro file is located (e.g. $HOME/4thRC/stacks/youbot-ros-pkg/youbot_common/youbot_description/robots)
2- run the command:
	rosrun xacro xacro.py youbot.urdf.xacro > youbot_complete.urdf.xml
	
   where youbot.urdf.xacro is the name of the main urdf file with macros to be processed and youbot_complete.urdf.xml is
   the plain urdf file.
   
   You can use arm.urdf.xacro as main file, in that case you will obtain only the arm model of the robot.
